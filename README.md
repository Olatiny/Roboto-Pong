# NOTES ABOUT GAMEPLAY
- For this project, to make it unique, I combined it with another arcade classic (Asteroids) to increase the chaos!
   - Every 5 seconds, a random number of asteroids will spawn (up to a maximum that can be on screen at once)
   - These are reset every time a player scores
   - This decision was made for balance, it is timed so that the losing player doesn't have to deal with the asteroids right after serve
- Outside the asteroids, normal pong rules:
   - First to 11 wins
   - Ball increases its speed when it hits paddles

# HOW TO PLAY
 - If you just want to play the game, either clone the repo or download the "Build.zip" file directly, extract the files, and run "Pong with a Twist.exe"
 - If you want to open the unity project, add the project in the "Pong with a Twist" folder to your unity hub and open it.
   - Note: this requires Unity version 2022.3.24.f1, as this was the version the project was developed for.
