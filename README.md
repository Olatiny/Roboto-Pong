# NOTES ABOUT GAMEPLAY
- For this project, to make it unique, I combined it with another arcade classic (Asteroids) to increase the chaos!
   - Every 5 seconds, a random number of asteroids will spawn (up to a maximum that can be on screen at once)
   - These are reset every time a player scores
   - This decision was made for balance, it is timed so that the losing player doesn't have to deal with the asteroids right after serve
- Outside the asteroids, normal pong rules:
   - First to 11 wins
   - Ball increases its speed when it hits paddles
